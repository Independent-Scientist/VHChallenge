# VanHack Challenge

  Since i was not sure if I could use third-party libraries I've decided to write all parts my own. 
From a very simple Object Serializer into binary data to send data back and forth through the pipe connection.
Didn't use obscure C++ syntax. At first, I though on using COM to register dynamic code into the server but I realized i wouldn't have enough time to implement.
Also did not have time to implement Asynchronous calls
